Projects from my CMSCI 256 class. 

Most of the projects done here are made using HTML, PHP, XML, Java, and Javascript.
This course covers important programming concepts that are necessary for modern software. These
include: design patterns, testing, GUIs, threading, client-server networking, security, and mobile
app development. Students will design and implement one or more moderately-sized programming
projects
